Example
=======

View the `complete example <_static/CNit_example_TRENDY_DGVMs_emulation.html>`_
showing a full CNit workflow with code, outputs, and visualizations.  This example
demonstrates:

* Loading TRENDY forcing and target data
* Configuring and running the CNit model (with calibrated parameters, i.e., emulator for TRENDY DGVMs)
* Analyzing and plotting results

The example shows all code, printed outputs, and generated figures from a real
CNit analysis.
